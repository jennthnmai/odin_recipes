        <h1>Keto Shrimp Scampi</h1>
        <img src="images/shrimpPic.jpeg" alt="shrimpPic">
        <h4>This shrimp scampi is transformed into a keto meal by using shirataki noodles. I like to double the amount of crushed red chiles for an extra kick! 
            This will make 3 lunch-sized portions or 2 dinner-sized portions. Grate some Parmesan cheese on top before serving, if desired.</h4>

            <li>Transfer shrimp to a bowl, reserving pan drippings in the skillet. Whisk lemon juice and white wine into the skillet.
